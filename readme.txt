In application.properties one can Specify many default properties.
        mainly context and port (I have specified the same in this project)

Above properties are for Spring version earlier than 2.0. (This project is 1.5.7)
For above versions:
    server.servlet.contextPath and server.port

We can also configure same using application.yml
